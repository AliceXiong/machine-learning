# machine-learning

I enjoyed this course taught by Ng in Courser so much. It provided me hands on experiences to the commonly used ML techniques in such a easy way. 

I finished these HWs in Matlab. Since I am a python lover, so I translated the majority of Matlab code into python. Feel free to borrow or modify it for your work. And if you enjoy modelings like I do, feel free to drop me a message or share any of your ideas at alicex.math@gmail.com
